TODO 

* Take input from @ARGV as the initial search string
* check why it crashes when switching back and forth from a large window to a
  really small window repeatedly
* Optimize the drawing routines (may require rewrite of callbacks)
* Place getch in appropriate window instead of stdscr
* Use a separate process/thread to produce data in a non-blocking manner
  (callbacks)
* Find out why the _HACK_RESIZE is needed and remove if possible
* Cleaner logging (e.g. debug option)
* Add switching of searching methods
