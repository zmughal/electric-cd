A quick directory changer

Initial release: works-for-me version

To use add something similar to the following to your shell
---
# ecd
if [ -r "/path/to/electric-cd/doc/ecd-include.sh" ]; then
	export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/electric-cd/bin"
	. "/path/to/electric-cd/doc/ecd-include.sh"
fi
---

Usage:
The top portion of the screen is the editing component. You can start typing
and use the backspace, delete, and arrow keys, as well as Ctrl-U and Ctrl-K.

The bottom portion is the list component. You can use the arrow keys to
navigate, as well as j/k like vi. Use Enter/Return to select an item.

When using the list component, one can use the symbols indicated in the left
side of screen to jump to a specific line. If that line is already highlighted,
then it will be selected.

To switch between the components use the Tab key.
